# Backend Ecommerce Application
  
## Description
This project is all about what happens behind the scenes of an ecommerce website, using only the backend to navigate and perform actions! From retrieving pre-existing information to making new items to add, from updating pre-existing items to deleting them from the database, this application showcases what exactly sequelize and mysql does behind the scenes in their databases.
  
## Installation Instructions
Using npm install, dotenv (for privacy), express, mysql2, and sequelize are downloaded to the application so that all the code functions properly.
  
## Usage
To use this project, I used an app called Insomnia to access the backend actions of my application. If it needs to be created, create the database in mysql, run the seed database using npm run seed, and call upon the application using npm start. From there, type in the localhost link with the active port into insomnia and create the pages for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes. Each route (categories, products, and tags) are required to have their own location in the link. Remember that these are apis, so it would look like "/api/categories".
